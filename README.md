# Juan Manuel Aidar

"The game "4 in a row" is a two-player strategy game played on a vertical board with 6 columns and 7 rows. The objective is to be the first to connect four pieces of the same color vertically, horizontally or diagonally on the board. Each player chooses a color (usually red or yellow) and takes turns dropping a tile on the top of any column. The token will fall towards the lowest position available in that column. Play continues until one of the players connects four tiles or until the board is full, resulting in a tie. The key to the game lies in blocking the opponent's plays while seeking to build your own line. "4 in a row" is easy to understand but requires strategy and anticipation to win"
